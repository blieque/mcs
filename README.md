# mcs

*A Bash script to make management of a few Minecraft servers easier.*

`mcs` is a Bash script I have written and evolved over the years to make
management of a handful of small Minecraft servers easier. This might be handy
for running a server or two for you and your friends to play on.

The script is built for Linux, and uses a number of Linux command-line tools. It
can likely be made to work on macOS fairly easily, but Windows would be a bit
trickier.
